# JavaScript-Promise Integration Proposal for WebAssembly

This repository is a clone of [github.com/WebAssembly/spec/](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/).
It is meant for discussion, prototype specification and implementation of a proposal to
add support for different patterns of non-local control flow to WebAssembly.

* See the [overview](proposals/js-promise-integration/Overview.md) for a summary of the proposal.

* See the [modified spec](https://webassembly.github.io/js-promise-integration/) for details.

* See the [Design Portfolio](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Us-pyte2-9DECJDfGm5tnUpfngJJOc8jbj54HMqE9Y/edit#heading=h.n1atlriavj6v) for detailed design from a V8 perspective.

Original `README` from upstream repository follows…

# spec

This repository holds the sources for the WebAssembly draft specification
(to seed a future
[WebAssembly Working Group](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2017Jun/0005.html)),
a reference implementation, and the official testsuite.

A formatted version of the spec is available here:
[webassembly.github.io/spec](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/),

Participation is welcome. Discussions about new features, significant semantic
changes, or any specification change likely to generate substantial discussion
should take place in
[the WebAssembly design repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design)
first, so that this spec repository can remain focused. And please follow the
[guidelines for contributing](Contributing.md).
